                <h3 id="submissions-open">When do submissions open?</h3>
                <p>
                    Session submissions usually opens a couple of months in advance of the DDD event. This allows us time
                    to collate all the submissions, vote on the submissions, and create an agenda for the day from the
                    results of the voting process.

                <h3 id="session-length">How long should my session be?</h3>
                <p>
                    Sessions at DDD events last for one hour.
                </p>

                <h3 id="session-topics">What topics do you accept sessions on?</h3>
                <p>
                    Anything relevant to a .NET developer! Other DDD events have seen submissions on the Raspberry Pi and
                    Gadgeteer, Unit Testing and Test-Driven Development, NoSQL databases like RavenDB and Redis, JavaScript,
                    mobile devices. &quot;Softer&quot; topics such as best practices, agile software development, and taking
                    your side project to a prime time business, have also been presented.
                </p>

                <h3 id="session-format">What format do sessions at DDD events take?</h3>
                <p>
                    DDD sessions are usually single-speaker talks on a specific subject, although some have featured multiple
                    speakers. Technical sessions, particularly those featuring hardware elements (e.g. Raspberry Pi), work
                    well when demos and code samples are included. That said, we also welcome sessions that are based around a
                    new format not yet presented at a DDD event.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some DDD events have run panel discussions and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon_debate">balloon debates</a>.
                    These are usually at the inception of the event organisers rather than through submissions.

                <h3 id="session-expertise">Do I need to be an expert in my topic?</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>No.</strong> One of the aims of DDD events is to grow the local speaker community, which means
                    favouring new speakers as well as local speakers. DDD audiences are interested in hearing about what you've
                    learned about the topic that you are speaking on; being introduced to a new topic, idea, or technology; or
                    hearing about your experiences with a project you have been working on.
