                This year is Øredev's 10th Anniversary and first of all, we thank you all for joining us on this 10 year long journey, for believing in us and making Øredev a great experience through your participation.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the anniversary, we chose a theme which will allow us to celebrate our passion for software. This year will all be about love. All speakers are asked to let us know the reasons for their passion and attraction to the languages, tools and methods they use — what motivates them to wake up every morning and go coding.
            </p>
            <p>
                Speaking from their love for their work, our speakers will deliver insights, methodological approaches and technical knowledge that can be put in your toolbox and put into practice when you go back to work. We hope you will enjoy the ride!

                ØREDEV was founded in 2005 by Jayway, a company comprised of and focused on specialists within IT. Øredev inherited this company's vision and philosophy.

                Our Philosophy Having fun! We are passionate about our work and organizing the Øredev conference is a thrill. Each year is unique, with new topics, new speakers, and new challenges. As such we have to constantly evolve and reinvent ourselves. This is both what makes our work fun for us and why we believe others having fun as a result of work is so important.
