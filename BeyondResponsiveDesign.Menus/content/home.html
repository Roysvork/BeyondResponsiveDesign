                    Developer! Developer! Developer! (DDD) East Anglia is the newest event in the popular series of
                    Developer Days events for the UK .NET Community that have run since May 2005. Although each DDD
                    event has its own particular "flavour", they remain immensely popular and enjoyable, regularly
                    attracting 200-300 attendees and often selling out within minutes.
                </p>

                <p>
                    DDD events were started on the following five principles, which we intend to adhere to in their spirit:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>For the community by the community</li>
                    <li>Free to attend</li>
                    <li>Held on a Saturday or non-work day</li>
                    <li>No Microsoft speakers (with some exceptions)</li>
                    <li>Grow the local speaker community</li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                    Sessions are submitted
                    by members of the community and selected by attendees. Microsoft speakers are generally not permitted
                    to speak at DDD events, but the exceptions to this rule are Microsoft employees who are active members
                    of the UK .NET community. In short, these are sessions crafted <em>by</em> developers <em>for</em>
                    developers, with no sales pitches allowed!
                </p>

                </h2>

                    DDD events are unique in that <strong>the conference is made by its attendees</strong>.
                    Sessions are submitted by members of the UK .NET developer community
                    (i.e. <em>you</em> can submit a session
                    if you want to), and are voted on by prospective attendees (i.e. you) before registration opens. The
                    organisers of DDD events use the results of the voting to determine which sessions are most popular,
                    and so which will make for the best event for attendees.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The results of voting are weighted to uphold the five principles of DDD events, so we will favour new
                    and local speakers over established speakers or speakers from a more remote geographical location.
