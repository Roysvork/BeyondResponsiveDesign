During our time putting the internet in the Philips Hue lightbulbs, we encountered interesting challenges. How do you create a cost-effective IoT architecture that scales? What changes when your product has both a local and a remote API, each with different capabilities? An architectural overview, war stories and passing on some key learnings.</div>

On his site he publishes deep analyses and critiques of interfaces seen in science fiction films and television.<br><br>For Øredev’s Man Love Machine theme, Noessel will deconstruct one of the most compelling and yet flawed technologies seen in recent sci-fi cinema: The eponymous OS1 in Spike Jonze’ Her. He’ll walk step by step through the narrative in which Theodore Twombly uses and falls in love with Samantha, an artificial intelligence sold as an operating system. In analyzing OS1 as an interface, interactions, a wearable computer, and a service, we’ll see how Jonze’s vision illustrates the edges of a design problem for the future of artificial intelligence, as well as the existential problems of falling in love with a machine.<br><br>Finally, Noessel will conclude by talking about the future of technologists, designers, and lovers in a world where artificial intelligence exists.<br></div>

This session will provide new quantitative and qualitative analysis of the modern SW Supply Chain. There's been a dramatic shift from writing code to assembling it, with open-source and third-party components providing the innovation and efficiency developers need. This dependence on components is growing faster than the ability to secure them. As with Heartbleed, Struts, and the like, shared components are increasingly shared risk. Worse, components are increasingly the preferred attack surface in today’s applications. Growing dependence, coupled with poor security visibility, requires small but important adjustments to application development. Join us for fresh analysis and practical ways to minimize avoidable risk and rework.</div>

This talk will demonstrate developing and deploying a web application to an application server running on a raspberry pi embedded in a silly hat.</div>

He keeps coming to Oredev to tell stories of how he walks the talk. He has transformed the idea from using social media to understand users to using what the users say to help Engineering and Business make powerful important decisions. He is going to demo his tool and show you how testers and other stakeholders are going to become more powerful influencers on projects. The power of user is such.</div>

Once, cloud was simply the tool you used to access your files from anywhere and to make your IT operations more efficient. Today, it’s an incubator of ideas that can help you continually test, adjust and deploy new innovations more nimbly than ever before. This session will introduce you to the next wave of platforms where you can easily collaborate across the globe, or be a hero, to build, test, deploy and manage new solutions in the cloud rapidly. To achieve this IBM continues to contribute and embrace open-standards, and has built a cloud-based platform for building, managing, and running apps of all types, such as web, mobile, big data, cognitive tasks and smart devices.

The team readily recognizes the testers need to work with the developers but the same team often doesn’t consider that the testers also need to work with the UX staff. Often the UX staff is tucked away in a different part of the office, working with multiple teams and yet, rarely working directly with the testers. Why? How can testers review a product without a good understanding of the design? Testers need closer access to UX and UX would benefit from working directly with the testers. Karen highlights specific design areas where UX and testing pair well.</div>
