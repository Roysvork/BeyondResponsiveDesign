Kristian will talk about how Spotify built the Continuous Deployment pipeline for its web player, and changed the way manual testing was performed. Also, the tools involved which mostly are open source (Gerrit, Selenium, GraphWalker) will be discussed. </div>

You’ll hear chilling tales about how interfaces, LINQ, and general-purpose server APIs have caused us so much grief.

There are some fantastic tools out there (nagios, icinga etc.) but these feel like operational tools.<br><br>During this session, Paul will show you that a developer can use Puppet (an infrastructure management tool) and automate their system checks. This will include how to centrally log errors and how to throw these errors to specific alerting systems based on their criticality. Monitoring should be simple and easy to maintain.

The SOLID principles are excellent design guidelines, but experience shows that programmers find them difficult to follow. What do we do about this? Surprisingly, the Structured Design literature of forty years ago contains compelling solutions to many current design problems. They're simple and easy to understand, but were lost in the noise as OO rose to popularity. We'll reinterpret these simple design ideas in a modern context, finding that many of our most promising new design ideas resemble them. Rapid web application development, the area of professional programming in most dire need of design improvements, will serve as an example.</div>

They pick technologies best-suited for their unique circumstances and favor quick access to tools. When it comes to application delivery, you can’t ignore the importance of messaging runtime. Attend this webcast to find out how IBM MQ Light and IBM MQ Light for Bluemix— the new lightweight messaging solution that can make applications more responsive and easier to scale— provide a simple messaging API that developers can install, configure, and use to write applications in just a few minutes. Learn more from the creators of this tool on how it will help all developers accelerate application delivery and contribute to the evolution of MQ messaging. </div>

It makes it easy to create lightweight, portable, and self-sufficient containers. Containers which you can use to test applications, build and run services or even to build your own platform-as-a-service. Learn why Docker matters, how to get started with it and see some cool examples of Docker in action.</div>
