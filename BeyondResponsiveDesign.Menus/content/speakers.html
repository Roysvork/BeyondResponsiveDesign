                                        Jeff Garzik is a software engineer, blogger, futurist and entrepreneur.

                                        In July 2010, while reading slashdot.org, Jeff stumbled across a post describing bitcoin. Immediately recognizing the potential of a concept previously thought impossible -- decentralized digital money -- Jeff did what came naturally: developed bitcoin open source software, and started micro-businesses with bitcoin at their foundation. Almost by accident, Jeff found himself square in the middle of the global, disruptive, amazing hurricane of a technological phenomenon known as bitcoin.

                                        Jeff now works as a bitcoin core developer and open source evangelist at BitPay. Jeff is also the CEO of Dunvegan Space Systems and Sleepy Dragon Properties, both one-man micro-businesses. Dunvegan Space Systems is the manager of the BitSat project.

                                        No longer a part of the system, Rob left his last enterprise development two years ago and spent a year doing two-week contracts for a combination of food, shelter and occasionally money in any technology at hand.

                                        He is an aficionado of Clojure, in a love/hate relationship with JS and now works as an Erlang developer on a 100% remote basis.

Currently we've handed out free cell phones to 1000 students at DTU and we're studying their interactions face-to-face, via telecommunications, and social networks. The most detailed social dataset in the world.

                Anders is a father of three, a sailor and an information junkie. He is a developer turned entrepreneur or vice versa depending on the viewers angle. Anders truly believes that trust and passion will take you all the way and can't understand the concept of not mixing business and pleasure.

                He has started companies in Stockholm, New Dehli and Malta and if he were to adopt the agile manifesto to a business manifesto it would probably be something like this:

                Trust in people over ... Everything!
