There's a lot to be excited about - class syntax, generators, arrow functions, modules, promises, and enough syntactic sugar to keep you up past bedtime.  The latest drops of Chrome and node.js make it easier than ever to start building ES6 applications both on the client and the server.  This talk is going to go in depth on the most important features of ES6, and show you how to use many of them today in an ES5 kind of world.  </div>

In this talk, I will use deeply personal and completely biased examples to describe why I hate JavaScript. I will then provide additional reasons why the entire web stack is a thing that should not be tolerated by moral human beings. I will also describe some of my futile research efforts to make web browsers moderately less the worse thing ever.</div>

If there were no pointers? What can we learn by exploring a set of dangerous and tricksy alternate realities?</div>

How do we deal with things like grouping functionality, loose coupling and consequently dependency injection?</div>

It was also very difficult for them to understand how their software would react when releasing it into a production environment as they didn't really understand how that environment was configured. What if there was a way that developers could create the scripts needed to install dependencies and get the software running as it is developed? Vagrant does exactly this, it is a tool to create and configure lightweight, reproducible, and portable development environments. In this session, I will show you how to create a development work flow that will allow developers to use Vagrant to create a real continuous delivery pipeline. This means understanding the environment needs as well as what is needed to run the software. I will also show how we, at OpenTable, integrate Vagrant into our pipeline to allow us to create a good acceptance testing environment against known data sets rather than having brittle test.</div>
