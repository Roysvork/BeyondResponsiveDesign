            <section>
                <p>Many layout frameworks came about in order to solve problems that we no longer have with modern browsers and tools.</p>
                <p>A lot of the problems arguable never existed in the first place, and were perhaps a product of developer laziness!</p>
                <p>All to often we try and apply webSITE techniques to web applications, or conversely try to mimick the desktop. Either approach has a tendancy to land us in a world of pain</p>
                <h3>Beyond, not past</h3>
                <p>It's important to note that we still need to utilise some elements of responsive design to allow our UI to make certain decisions</p>
                <p>This isn't a bad thing, nor does it go against the abstract of this talk. We should embrace responsive design but also note how going back to basics can eliminate a lot of problems before they even need to be solved</p>
                <h3>Simplify simplify simplify!</h3>
                <p>Why do we need everything to be resizable? Why not make the correct decisions up front in order to conserve real estate and keep the user experience focussed.</p>
                <h3>What even is a 'single page application'?</h3>
                <p>It's probably not what you think it is... or maybe it's just not what *I* think it is</p>
                <p>What is a 'page'... is it a single html page? Or a logical page i.e a distinct view of the application?</p>
                <p>Is a sliding pane still a page? Does it really matter if the URI is changing and history is being kept?</p>
                <h3>Context is king</h3>
                <p>Standard web does a good job of tracking context for us. But we need more in a single page application right?</p>
                <p>Wrong! Most of the time context is not required to be complex and this can be encoded in the URI\Browser history just like a regular web app</p>
                <h3>What's on the menu?</h3>
                <p>There are several approaches to menus that we see being used on mobile apps at the moment:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Title bar menu - Used by pretty much all apps, often contains search, hamburger buttons (see below) and navigation (iOS)</li>
                    <li>Hamburger left\right sliding menu - Facebook, Gmail, Wordpress</li>
                    <li>Elipsis pop-out menu - App level settings. Gmail, Wordpress</li>
                    <li>Toolbar - Context-specific - can be used as a substitute for tabs (Facebook, Google Play, Twitter) or for performing actions</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Which approach you choose depends on a number of factors:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Context specific actions</li>
                    <li>Do you display many views of similar data, or is your app composed of many distinct parts?</li>
                    <li>Features vs Available screen real estate</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Of course, there's no real right answer and most apps will mix and match and use combinations</p>
                <h3>Happy middleground</h3>
                <p>There are also times where mobile-friendly features don't work so well on the pc, and so we should really drop these in favour of other approaches that do work on all.</p>
                <p>For example, both Wordpress and Facebook display available actions at the bottom of the screen - not a long way on mobile but could well be on the browser!</p>
